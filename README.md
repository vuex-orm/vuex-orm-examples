# Vuex ORM Examples

The example application to demonstrate the use case of the [Vuex ORM](https://github.com/revolver-app/vuex-orm). It's a simple ToDo application which can add assignee to each todo. You can see how Vuex ORM connects those two models – Todo and Assignee – and how to create, edit and delete them.
